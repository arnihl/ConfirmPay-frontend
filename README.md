# ConfirmPay-frontend

## Installation instructions

Installation instructions: 

1. Clone the project. 

2. We used Pixel API 3 with Q API, level 29, Android 10.0 OS, to run the program. Something similar should be fine since we dont use anything else than basic android libraries, except for Retrofit. 

3. The backend is stored on heroku and starts up when the android program is started. The startup can take some time and thus you may get a network timeout error the first time you start it the android app. When you see the events displayed on the frontpage of the app the backend is live and can be used. 

We recommend you start the android app in android studios, wait 20-30 seconds and start it again.
